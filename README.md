# Distance
## Minecraft spigot plugin
Calculates the distance between 2 players on the same world.
This plugin should work with any Minecraft spigot server version, the older ones and the upcoming also.

The main idea for this plugin is to utilize the [Fast inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root) method for more efficient square rooting needed for the distance.

## Command
/distance [player1] [player2]
- There are no permissions needed to run the command.
